# Video Resolution
MoviePy is a Python module for editing videos. It can cut and arrange clips, add video effects, and edit audio. It can work like a toolbox, if you only make changes to one clip. If you have to edit lots of clips, MoviePy can automate that process.

## Installing 

**Method with pip:** if you have pip installed, just type this in a terminal ```pip install moviepy```
